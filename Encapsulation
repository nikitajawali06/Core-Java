DEFINITION :
Binding data and code together keeping the data safe from outside environment.

How we can achieve : 
By making all members private and access using public modifiers such as Getter and Setter methods.

ENCAPSULATION: Data hiding + Abstraction.

TERMS :
1)Setter method - 1)Used for updating the values
                  2)Also called Mutator method
2)Getter method - 1)Used for returing the values
                  2)Also called Accessor method
 
 Example of Encapsulated class: Java Bean class
 
 WHY ENCAPSULATION :
 It helps for data hiding, protection and increase security.
 
 DISADVANTAGES:
 Lengthy codes and slow execution.
                  
 REAL LIFE EXAMPLES :
 1)When we login into gmail accounts a lot of internal process will going on and we have no control over it.
 Only access public modifier that is visible that is login and password. 
 After entering details into login and password some internal functionals occurs that is not visible and no control over it.
 Thus gmail keeps your account safe from others.
 
 2)Working of AC in which all functions are private and we can access only public modifier ie remote to change the temperature of AC.

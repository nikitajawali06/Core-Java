         2)Refers to inheritance
         3)Uses extends keyword

Types of inheritance:

1)Single inheritance :When a class extends only one class.


2)Multiple inheritance :When class inherit the derived class they making the derived class as base class to new class.


3)Multilevel inheritance :In this one sub class has many supeclass but this is not supported in java.
                          This is not supported in java have same method name and signature because of ambiguity problem
                          This problem can be solved by making one class interface


4)Hierarchial inheritance:One class is inherited by many class.

5)Hybrid inheritance:It is a combination of single and multiple inheritance.

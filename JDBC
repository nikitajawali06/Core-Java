It is used to provide a connectivity between java applications and database servers.

STEPS :-
1)import the package
  import java.sql.*;
2)Load/Register the Driver class
  Class.ForName("Driver Manager path");
3)Creating connection
  Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("path/db","username","password");
4)Create Query
  1)Statement:-
    1)It is used when when have to deal with static queries.
    2)No user defined values can be taken.
    3)It's get complied everytime hence performance is low.
    4)It is used when we have to write query only once.
    5)No protection form SQL Injection.
    
  2)Prepared Statement:-
    1)It is used when when have to deal with dynamic queries.
    2)User defined values can be taken.
    3)It's get complied only once hence performance is high.
    4)It is used when we have to write query multiple times.
    5)Protection form SQL Injection.
    
  3)Collable Statement:-
    It is used when we have to write PL/SQL queries
    
5)Exceute Query
   1)executeUpdate() :- It executes and runs your query
                        Return type --> int
                        It returns the number of rows and columns affected
                        It is used when we are dealing with DML.

   
   2)executeQuery() :-  It has a power to store whole data in it.
                        Return type --> ResultSet
                        It returns the data that is store in resultSet
                        It is used when we are dealing with DQL.
                        
   
   3)exeute() :- It will tell whether the query is executed or not
                 Return type- Boolean
    
  
  6) Closing the Environment :- It is used to close all the connections to prevent leakages.
